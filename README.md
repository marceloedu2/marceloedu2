### About me
I am a technology enthusiast, I always try to stay on top of news in the area, especially when it comes to programming. Programming is something that makes me very excited, because I see that creating a solution for something through lines of code is like building a house and seeing the result with each brick placed. I like to feel part of something that can help someone solve their problems more quickly and efficiently, and I dedicate myself to making this possible in the best way.
